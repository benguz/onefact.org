It is a place where someone can live, have access to social supports such as transportation, and receive assistance with activities of daily living. For example, an individual with serious mental illness who lives in a group home may need staff assistance with taking medications, while an elderly person living in an assisted living facility may require help with activities of daily living, such as getting dressed or eating.\nWhy does this matter?\nIn the United States, some states allow people who are disabled or have serious mental illness like schizophrenia to receive money for housing via the Medicaid program. However, to find a group home is extremely difficult and can require many phone calls to social workers, hospitals, and various other services. The fact is, until we created this dataset, there was no way someone with mental illness (or their family or care team) could access a list of addresses where they could live with government support. If we care about a social safety net, having data on what this looks like matters.\nHere is the dataset (13MB) as a CSV. Here is the github repo, which contains all scripts used to process, clean, and analyze the data, as well as all raw data gathered from state licensing agencies.\nThe data was collected over the course of summer 2021.
