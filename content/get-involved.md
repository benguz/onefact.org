- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [codebase](https://github.com/onefact/assisted-living/) for the open dataset

  - [ ] Your brief CV
  - [ ] Answers to the following questions:
    - [ ] What interests you most about our project?
    - [ ] As mentors and project coordinators, how can we get the best out of you?
    - [ ] Is there anything that you’ll be studying or working on whilst working alongside us? List any exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc. We can work around a lot of things, but it helps to know in advance.
    - [ ] Are there any techniques and tools which you use to keep yourself organized?
    - [ ] What are your plans for the future? (This will help us best support you to achieve them!)
    - [ ] If you want to propose your own idea then please include outline, goals, and a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables.
    - [ ] If you're applying to more than one organization, you can let us know which one you prefer in case of a tie.
- [ ]  Write your application (with help from your mentors!). All applications must go through Google's application system; we can't accept any application unless it is submitted there. Make it easy for your mentors to give you feedback. If you're using Google docs, enable comments and submit a "draft" (we can't see the "final" versions until applications close). If you're using a format that doesn't accept comments, make sure your email is on the document and don't forget to check for feedback!
- [ ] Submit your application to Google before the deadline. We actually recommend you submit a few days early in case you have internet problems or the system is down. Google does not extend this deadline, so it's best to be prepared early! You can edit your application up until the system closes.
